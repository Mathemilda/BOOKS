This is a folder were you can find a book of complied [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) courses passed by me, Mya Bakhova. They are originally published on https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/, in HTML format, with a separate webpage for each section. I emailed to Neo4j GraphAcademy to check what they think of it, and they did not reply. So I go with "if it is not forbidden, then it is allowed". 

I wanted a reference where I can do a global search and eventually I plan to add index section with main concepts. As a data scientist, I was selecting courses which are beneficial for me. I started with 3 courses (Neo4j Fundamentals, Cypher Fundamentals, Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals) and I plan to add others. Each chapter is devoted to one course and has a link to it.

Do not hesitate to inform me if you found mistakes of any kind in the book. I will appreciate positive comments, too!
